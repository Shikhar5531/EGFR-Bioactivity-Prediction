# 🧬 EGFR Bioactivity Prediction using Cheminformatics & Machine Learning

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

This project explores the prediction of **bioactivity** (IC₅₀) for compounds targeting the **Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)** using molecular fingerprints and physicochemical descriptors. The goal is to distinguish between **active and inactive compounds** with respect to their inhibitory effect on EGFR, a critical target in cancer therapy.

> 🚀 Built using **Python**, **RDKit**, **scikit-learn**, and **Optuna**, this project is a reproducible pipeline from raw SMILES strings to an optimized Random Forest classifier.

## 📍 Motivation

Modern drug discovery is **costly**, **time-consuming**, and faces a high attrition rate in clinical pipelines. **Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD)** can help streamline this process by leveraging cheminformatics and machine learning to:

- Prioritize candidate molecules before synthesis.
- Reduce the cost of wet-lab screening.
- Offer interpretable insights into structure-activity relationships (SAR).

This project aims to **perform a practical application of CADD** for bioactivity prediction, starting from raw chemical data and ending with a robust machine learning model.

---

## 🧪 Dataset

- **Source**: [ChEMBL Database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/)
- **Target Protein**: EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)
- **Activity Metric**: IC₅₀ values
- **Size**: ~1000 curated compounds after preprocessing

Bioactivity was binarized:
- `Active (1)` if pIC₅₀ ≥ 6
- `Inactive (0)` otherwise

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

The pipeline includes:

1. **Data Curation**:
   - Filtering for standard, human-targeted assays
   - Handling duplicates, removing unreliable data points

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Molecular fingerprints (1024-bit Morgan Fingerprints via RDKit)
   - Physicochemical descriptors: MW, LogP, NumHDonors, NumHAcceptors

3. **Modeling**:
   - **Random Forest Classifier** with `class_weight="balanced"`
   - Hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna**
   - Validation via **Nested Cross-Validation** and hold-out test set

4. **Evaluation**:
   - F1-score, ROC-AUC, learning curve, confusion matrix, and feature importances

## 📊 Results

**Final Evaluation on Test Set**:
| Metric           | Value   |
|------------------|---------|
| Accuracy         | 91%     |
| F1-Score         | 0.94    |
| ROC-AUC          | 0.89    |
| Minority Class F1 (Inactive) | 0.75 |

**Hyperparameters Used**:
```json
{
  "n_estimators": 105,
  "max_depth": 12,
  "min_samples_split": 2,
  "min_samples_leaf": 1,
  "max_features": "log2"
}
```

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Fingerprint features dominate** in feature importance, confirming that specific substructures are vital in EGFR inhibition.
- **Physicochemical descriptors**, particularly LogP and MW, still ranked high (8th and 11th), reinforcing traditional SAR relevance.
- **class_weight='balanced'** was crucial to achieve fairness across classes. Without it, the model overestimated performance on active compounds.

---

## 🧬 Biological Relevance

- **EGFR** is a validated cancer target involved in cell proliferation and survival.
- This model mimics early-stage **virtual screening**: prioritizing which molecules should be tested in vitro.
- False negatives (actives missed) could be **novel scaffolds**, while false positives might indicate **structurally similar but biologically inactive compounds**, important leads for further research.

---

## 🔮 Potential Future Work

- Include **3D structure-based descriptors** or docking scores for richer feature sets.
- Explore **ensemble stacking** or **graph neural networks** for deeper learning.
- A future version could incorporate **regression modeling** for intermediate bioactivity ranges **(pIC50 6–7.5)**, enabling a hybrid **classification-regression pipeline**.

---

## 🚧 Limitations

This project was designed with a **narrow and well-defined scope**: predicting bioactivity for compounds targeting the **EGFR** protein in **humans**, using data filtered to include only:

- A **single assay type** (`B` – binding assay)
- A **single relation type** (`=` – exact IC₅₀ values)
- A **single target protein** (EGFR)

As a result, the model is **not generalizable** to:

- Other protein targets (even within the kinase family)
- Different species or assay types
- Broader IC₅₀ ranges or regression-based activity prediction

The purpose of this project was not to build a production-level model, but to:

- Gain hands-on experience with real-world chemical bioactivity data
- Apply machine learning rigorously in a **cheminformatics** setting
- Understand the foundational steps of **virtual screening**

This focused approach allowed for deeper learning, but also naturally limits the model’s current applicability to other biological scenarios.
